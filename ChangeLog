	* Removing explicit MySQL 5.1-specific 'IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE'
	  option.

2009-11-10  nickw

	* Closes #320: Filled in missing translations

2008-09-07  marcus

	* Fixes 334: Radio buttons were part of the problem, label and
	  option were the wrong way round (compare with input/checkboxes).
	  
	  Second part of the problem was actually with
	  views/default/notifications/settings/usersettings.php, where the
	  value of the field was incorrectly being extracted from the
	  settings array.
	  
	  Thanks for the spot!

2008-09-06  marcus

	* Closes #327: Thanks for the pointer. In the end I modified the

2008-08-25  marcus

	* Closes #254: If mb_string is installed then internationalised
	  usernames are supported in file system.
	  
	  Because of this I have raised mbstring from recommended to a
	  (non-fatal) core requirement.
	  
	  Because of the lack of a unicode ctype_alnum function the
	  validation occurs at username input. Because of this I have
	  improved the user registration code:
	  
	  This code now validates for special chars etc in the username. I
	  have also introduced the following new plugin hooks (which are
	  run after primary validation) which provide plugins with the
	  ability to add other requirements (extra security etc).
	  
	  'registeruser:validate:password'
	  'registeruser:validate:username'
	  'registeruser:validate:email'

	  Use the same technique as edit pages on widgets, i.e.
	  
	  1) Create a new view in your plugins view/default called
	  settings/PLUGINNAME/edit
	  
	  Where PLUGINNAME is the plugin directory, eg "river" or
	  "profile".
	  
	  2) Place your edit code in edit.php, fields should save to
	  params[fieldname].
	  
	  3) The view will be passed $vars['entity'] which holds any
	  configuration values already set in the metadata.

	* Marcus Povey <marcus@dushka.co.uk>
	  * Removed count based on this conversation:
	  
	  [10:05:38] … basically, if you add an item, you need to create a
	  tag entry in the metastrings table (as discussed yesterday)
	  [10:05:56] … if you then delete the item, that leaves a tag
	  [10:06:07] … if you want to delete the tag when nothing
	  references it
	  [10:06:11] … it needs a counter
	  [10:06:29] … which means for every add and delete query you need
	  to check for and sometimes update this counter
	  [10:06:36] … making three queries for every one
	  [10:06:47] … but if you don't do that the meta strings table
	  grows over time
	  [10:06:54] … making it space inefficient
	  [10:07:03] … so, which do you do?
	  [10:10:31] … ?
	  [10:10:43] … i'd be tempted to not delete
	  [10:10:58] … because the multiple queries will be a pain for
	  everyone all the time
	  [10:11:05] … and storage costs are cheap
	  [10:11:32] Ben Werdmuller: I would be very tempted to do the same
	  [10:11:35] … so let's do that :)
	  [10:11:36] Marcus Povey: maybe we could write an admin script to
	  clean up or something
	  [10:11:45] Ben Werdmuller: exactly, we could clean up on a cron
	  if people really want
	  [10:11:59] … but for now, let's just go with the growing tag
	  cloud
